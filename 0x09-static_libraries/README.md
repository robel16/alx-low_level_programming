# 0x09. C - Static libraries
## Resources
### man or help:
* ar
* ranlib
* nm
## Learning Objectives
at the end of the projec, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
## General
* what is a static library , how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm
## Requirements
* Allowed editors:  vi ,  vim ,  emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using  gcc , using the options  -Wall -
* Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A  README.md  file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the  Betty  style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl
(https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and betty-doc.pl
(https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like  printf ,  puts , etc... is
forbidden
* You are allowed to use _putchar
(https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
* You don’t have to push  _putchar.c , we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
* In the following examples, the  main.c  files are shown as examples. You can use them to test
your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into 
account). We will use our own  main.c  files at compilation. Our  main.c  files might be different
from the one shown in the examples
## Bash
* The first line of all your files should be exactly  #!/bin/bash
* A  README.md  file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
* All your files must be executable
